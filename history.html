        By March 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I
        computer and showed it to Jobs, who suggested that they sell it; Wozniak
        was at first skeptical of the idea but later agreed.[65] In April of
        that same year, Jobs, Wozniak, and administrative overseer Ronald Wayne
        founded Apple Computer Company (now called Apple Inc.) as a business
        partnership in Jobs's parents' Crist Drive home on April 1, 1976.[66]
        The operation originally started in Jobs's bedroom and later moved to
        the garage.[66][67] Wayne stayed only a short time, leaving Jobs and
        Wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company.[68] The two
        decided on the name "Apple" after Jobs returned from the All One Farm
        commune in Oregon and told Wozniak about his time spent in the farm's
        apple orchard.[69] Jobs originally planned to produce bare printed
        circuit boards of the Apple I and sell them to computer hobbyists for
        $50 each.[70][71] To raise the money they needed to build the first
        batch of the circuit boards, Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator
        and Jobs sold his Volkswagen van.[70][71] Later that year, computer
        retailer Paul Terrell purchased 50 fully assembled units of the Apple I
        from them for $500 each.[72][73] Eventually about 200 Apple I computers
        were produced in total.[74]

        A neighbor on Crist Drive recalled Jobs as an odd individual who would
        greet his clients "with his underwear hanging out, barefoot and
        hippie-like".[31] Another neighbor, Larry Waterland, who had just earned
        his PhD in chemical engineering at Stanford, recalled dismissing Jobs's
        budding business: "'You punched cards, put them in a big deck,' he said
        about the mainframe machines of that time. 'Steve took me over to the
        garage. He had a circuit board with a chip on it, a DuMont TV set, a
        Panasonic cassette tape deck and a keyboard. He said, 'This is an Apple
        computer.' I said, 'You've got to be joking.' I dismissed the whole
        idea.'"[31] Jobs's friend from Reed College and India, Daniel Kottke,
        recalled that as an early Apple employee, he "was the only person who
        worked in the garage ... Woz would show up once a week with his latest
        code. Steve Jobs didn't get his hands dirty in that sense." Kottke also
        stated that much of the early work took place in Jobs's kitchen, where
        he spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the
        company.[31]

        They received funding from a then-semi-retired Intel product marketing
        manager and engineer Mike Markkula.[75] Scott McNealy, one of the
        cofounders of Sun Microsystems, said that Jobs broke a "glass age
        ceiling" in Silicon Valley because he'd created a very successful
        company at a young age.[37] Markkula brought Apple to the attention of
        Arthur Rock, which after looking at the crowded Apple booth at the Home
        Brew Computer Show, started with a $60,000 investment and went on the
        Apple board.[76] Jobs was not pleased when Markkula recruited Mike Scott
        from National Semiconductor in February 1977 to serve as the first
        president and CEO of Apple

        After Brennan returned from her own journey to India, she and Jobs fell
        in love again, as Brennan noted changes in him that she attributes to
        Kobun (whom she was also still following). It was also at this time that
        Jobs displayed a prototype Apple I computer for Brennan and his parents
        in their living room. Brennan notes a shift in this time period, where
        the two main influences on Jobs were Apple Inc. and Kobun. By early
        1977, she and Jobs would spend time together at her home at Duveneck
        Ranch in Los Altos, which served as a hostel and environmental education
        center. In April 1977, Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the
        West Coast Computer Faire.[79] It is the first consumer product to have
        been sold by Apple Computer. Primarily designed by Wozniak, Jobs oversaw
        the development of its unusual case and Rod Holt developed the unique
        power supply.[80] During the design stage, Jobs argued that the Apple II
        should have two expansion slots, while Wozniak wanted eight. After a
        heated argument, Wozniak threatened that Jobs should "go get himself
        another computer". They later decided to go with eight slots.[81] The
        Apple II became one of the first highly successful mass-produced
        microcomputer products in the world.[82]

        As Jobs became more successful with his new company, his relationship
        with Brennan grew more complex. In 1977, the success of Apple was now a
        part of their relationship, and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved
        into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino.[citation needed]
        Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at
        Apple.[83] Brennan's relationship with Jobs deteriorated as his position
        with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship. In
        October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take
        "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples".[citation
        needed] Both Holt and Jobs believed that it would be a good position for
        her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she
        take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's
        decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she
        was pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to
        tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan "turned ugly" at the news.
        At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third
        trimester, Jobs said to her: "I never wanted to ask that you get an
        abortion. I just didn't want to do that."[citation needed] He also
        refused to discuss the pregnancy with her.[84] Brennan turned down the
        internship and decided to leave Apple. She stated that Jobs told her "If
        you give up this baby for adoption, you will be sorry" and "I am never
        going to help you."[citation needed] According to Brennan, Jobs "started
        to seed people with the notion that I slept around and he was infertile,
        which meant that this could not be his child." A few weeks before she
        was due to give birth, Brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the
        All One Farm. She accepted the offer.[citation needed] When Jobs was 23
        (the same age as his biological parents when they had him)[84] Brennan
        gave birth to her baby, Lisa Brennan, on May 17, 1978.[85] Jobs went
        there for the birth after he was contacted by Robert Friedland, their
        mutual friend and the farm owner. While distant, Jobs worked with her on
        a name for the baby, which they discussed while sitting in the fields on
        a blanket. Brennan suggested the name "Lisa" which Jobs also liked and
        notes that Jobs was very attached to the name "Lisa" while he "was also
        publicly denying paternity." She would discover later that during this
        time, Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted
        to give a female name (his first choice was "Claire" after St. Clare).
        She also stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby's
        name for a computer and he hid the plans from her. Jobs also worked with
        his team to come up with the phrase, "Local Integrated Software
        Architecture" as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa.[86]
        Decades later, however, Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson
        that "obviously, it was named for my daughter".[87]

        When Jobs denied paternity, a DNA test established him as Lisa's
        father.[clarification needed] It required him to give Brennan $385 a
        month in addition to returning the welfare money she had received. Jobs
        gave her $500 a month at the time when Apple went public and Jobs became
        a millionaire. Later, Brennan agreed to give an interview with Michael
        Moritz for Time magazine for its Time Person of the Year special,
        released on January 3, 1983, in which she discussed her relationship
        with Jobs. Rather than name Jobs the Person of the Year, the magazine
        named the computer[clarification needed] the "Machine of the Year".[88]
        In the issue, Jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test
        (which stated that the "probability of paternity for Jobs, Steven... is
        94.1%").[89] Jobs responded by arguing that "28% of the male population
        of the United States could be the father".[89] Time also noted that "the
        baby girl and the machine on which Apple has placed so much hope for the
        future share the same name: Lisa".[89]
